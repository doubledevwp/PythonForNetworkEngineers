Read the "show_vlan.txt" file into your program. Loop through the lines in this file and extract all of the VLAN_ID, VLAN_NAME combinations. From these VLAN_ID and VLAN_NAME construct a new list where each element in the list is a tuple consisting of (VLAN_ID, VLAN_NAME). Print this data structure to the screen. Your output should look as follows:

[('1', 'default'),<br>
 ('400', 'blue400'),<br>
 ('401', 'blue401'),<br>
 ('402', 'blue402'),<br>
 ('403', 'blue403')]
