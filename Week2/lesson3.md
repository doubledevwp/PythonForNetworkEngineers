Read in the `show_arp.txt` file using the `.readlines()` method. Use a list slice to remove the header line.

Use pretty print to print out the resulting list to the screen, syntax is:

> from pprint import pprint

> pprint(some_var)

Use the list `.sort()` method to sort the list based on IP addresses.

Create a new list slice that is only the first three ARP entries.

Use the `.join()` method to join these first three ARP entries back together as a single string using the newline character `('\n')` as the separator.

Write this string containing the three ARP entries out to a file named `arp_entries.txt`.
