Open the `show_version.txt` file for reading. Use the `.read()` method to read in the entire file contents to a variable. Print out the file contents to the screen. Also print out the type of the variable (you should have a string at this point).

Close the file.

Open the file a second time using a Python context manager (with statement). Read in the file contents using the `.readlines()` method. Print out the file contents to the screen. Also print out the type of the variable (you should have a list at this point).
